## Linear Regression
**Linear Regression** is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It aims to explain and predict the dependent variable based on one or more independent variables, finding the best-fitting straight line through the data points.

## Design of Experiment
**Design of Experiment** involves planning and conducting experiments effectively. It focuses on controlling and manipulating experimental conditions to obtain desired results. This methodology is used to optimize experimental outcomes by carefully designing and controlling variables.

## Sampling Theory
**Sampling Theory** deals with methods and principles of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population. It encompasses techniques to extract representative samples from a population and utilize them to make inferences or estimates about the entire population.
